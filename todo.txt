  capture verify
  refund / reverse

Tony Notes:
done - Capture Auth doesn't work;
done - after using a saved payment method it no longer shows as an option on checkout screen
done - refund transaction IDs don't show up on order screen
don't see this issue anymore - TransIt transaction IDs are all the same on the order screens
- Need to support fields for both the TSEP device ID and the MultiPass device ID; finished the cert by hard-coding the multi-pass device ID in the PHP SDK for the trans
- TSEP error doesn't show to customer, just sits there
done - Discover CUP card type isn't being passed to back-end; causes problems with TransIT

- Need to freeze screen on order submit w/TransIT. Screen doesn't show that anything is happening
